# rairbgames.com without the AI
The soon to be new homepage of rairbgames, fully made by a human. (I've been trying to use less AI for coding, proud to say I've never generated art or music with it.)

## No AI?
I've admittedly taken quite a heavy relience on Claude and the like to help me with coding when I am unfamiliar with a langauge, like anything to do with websites. I'm trying to do it right now by learning this myself much like I've learned Godot. I already am quite familar with JS so hopefully it won't take too long to figure out the rest.

## Editor's note
What the hell is React? (Day 1)
