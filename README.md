# rairbgames.com without the AI
The soon to be new homepage of rairbgames, fully made by a human. (I've been trying to use less AI for coding, proud to say I've never generated art or music with it.)

## No AI?
I've admittedly taken quite a heavy relience on Claude and the like to help me with coding when I am unfamiliar with a langauge, like anything to do with websites. I'm trying to do it right now by learning this myself much like I've learned Godot. I already am quite familar with JS so hopefully it won't take too long to figure out the rest.

## The experience
First questions:
What is React? | My proposed answer: A framework that uses components to build websites in a more clean way than just straight HTML
What is Vite? | My proposed answer: Helper package that serves as a translation layer between JSX files and something your browser can process
Should I be using typescript over javascript? | My proposed answer: I'm trying typescript cause I'm not used to it

Anyways, just got done installing 
"You are using Node.js 20.18.0. Vite requires Node.js version 20.19+ or 22.12+. Please upgrade your Node.js version."
Great.
